## 🔄 Currently In Development

### Bucket Properties Feature
**Status:** In Progress | **Priority:** Medium | **Target:** Phase 5 Enhancement

**Overview:** Adding comprehensive bucket property inspection capabilities to provide administrators with detailed visibility into bucket configurations and policies.

**Planned Features:**
- **General Tab:** Bucket creation date, object count, total size, Object Lock status
- **Policy Tab:** JSON bucket policy display with syntax highlighting
- **Lifecycle Tab:** Formatted lifecycle rules (transition, expiration, versioning)
- **Versioning Tab:** Current versioning status with enable/suspend options
- **CORS Tab:** Cross-origin resource sharing configuration (Enterprise MinIO only)

**Technical Implementation:**
- New `BucketPropertiesScreen` modal with tabbed interface
- Extended `MinioClient` with property retrieval methods:
  - `get_bucket_properties()` - general bucket information
  - `get_bucket_policy()` - bucket policy JSON
  - `get_bucket_lifecycle()` - lifecycle configuration
  - `get_bucket_versioning()` - versioning status
  - `get_bucket_cors()` - CORS configuration (with graceful fallback)
- New keybinding (likely 'i' for info/inspect) from bucket context
- Comprehensive error handling for unsupported features
- Test coverage for all new property methods

**MinIO Compatibility Research:**
- ✅ **Versioning:** Full S3-compatible support
- ✅ **Lifecycle:** Object transition, expiration, tiering supported  
- ✅ **Bucket Policies:** S3-compatible JSON policies supported
- ⚠️ **CORS:** Only available in MinIO Enterprise (paid version)

**UI Design:**
```
┌─────────── Bucket Properties: bucket-name ───────────┐
│ [General] [Policy] [Lifecycle] [Versioning] [CORS]   │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ Tab-specific content with syntax highlighting   │   │
│ │ for JSON/XML, formatted tables for rules,      │   │
│ │ and clear status indicators                     │   │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                      [Close]          │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Development Progress:**
- [x] Research S3/MinIO bucket property APIs and compatibility
- [x] Design bucket properties modal UI layout
- [x] **UI Improvements**: Enhanced context-aware keybindings and fixed tree leaf arrows
- [ ] Implement bucket property retrieval methods in MinioClient
- [ ] Create BucketPropertiesScreen modal with tabbed interface
- [ ] Add keybinding and action integration
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for new functionality
- [ ] Update documentation and help text

**Recent UI Enhancements:**
- [x] **Context-Aware Keybindings**: Footer now shows only relevant actions based on selection
  - Files: Download, Get URL, Metadata, Preview, Rename, Object Lock options
  - Directories: Upload, Upload URL, New Folder, Delete
  - Buckets: Create Bucket, Delete, Upload URL
- [x] **Tree View Polish**: Removed expand arrows from file leaf nodes (cleaner appearance)

The MinIO TUI has evolved into a feature-rich, professional-grade S3-compatible object storage management tool with enterprise features, advanced UI/UX, modern code preview capabilities, and comprehensive test coverage. The project has significantly exceeded its original scope while maintaining excellent code quality and user experience.
