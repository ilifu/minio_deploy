- [x] Context-sensitive keybindings with status bar
- [x] Bucket operations: create, delete, view contents
- [x] Object operations: upload, download, delete, rename
- [x] Directory operations: create folders, delete empty folders
- [x] Search and filter functionality for objects
- [x] Object metadata viewer with 'm' keybinding
- [x] Presigned URL generation with configurable expiration
- [x] Smart path prepopulation for uploads and directory creation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features âœ…
- [x] Enhanced bucket creation with Object Lock configuration
- [x] Individual object retention periods and legal holds
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [x] Dark mode toggle
- [x] Complete test coverage (app + client)
- [x] Security review completed
- [x] Documentation and packaging (`pyproject.toml`, README)

- [ ] **Upload progress** - Progress bars for large file uploads
- [ ] **Object versioning** - Support for S3 versioning features
- [ ] **Upload presigned URLs** - Generate URLs for client-side uploads
- [ ] **Bucket properties** - View bucket policies, CORS, lifecycle rules

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Enhanced UI** - File type icons, sortable columns
- [ ] **File preview** - Quick preview for small text files  
- [ ] **Quick actions** - Floating action panel
- [ ] **Debug mode** - Request logging and debug information

## ðŸ“Š Development Status

- **Lines of Code:** ~2,000+ (app.py: ~1,400, minio_client.py: ~400, tests: ~600)
- **Test Coverage:** 51/51 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Features Implemented:** 15+ major features
- **S3 API Methods:** 20+ different S3 operations supported
