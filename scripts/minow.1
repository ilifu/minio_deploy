.SH NAME
minow \- Terminal User Interface for MinIO S3-compatible object storage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minow
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B minow
is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) application for managing MinIO S3-compatible object storage servers. It provides a dual-panel interface with bucket management on the left and object browsing on the right, plus context-sensitive keybindings for efficient operations.

The application features comprehensive bucket and object management, Object Lock support for WORM compliance, file previews with syntax highlighting, progress tracking for uploads/downloads, and presigned URL generation.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.B minow
can be configured using TOML configuration files or environment variables. Configuration files are searched in the following order:

.IP "1." 4
.B config.toml
in the current directory
.IP "2." 4
.B minio_tui.toml
in the current directory
.IP "3." 4
.B ~/.config/minio_tui/config.toml
in the user's home directory

.SS Configuration File Format
Configuration files use TOML format:

.EX
[minio]
endpoint_url = "https://your-minio-server.com"
access_key = "your-access-key"
secret_key = "your-secret-key"
.EE

.SS Environment Variables
Environment variables can be used to override configuration file settings. All variables use the prefix
.BR MINIO_TUI_ :

.TP
.B MINIO_TUI_MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL
MinIO server endpoint URL
.TP
.B MINIO_TUI_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
Access key for authentication
.TP
.B MINIO_TUI_MINIO_SECRET_KEY
Secret key for authentication

Example:
.EX
export MINIO_TUI_MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL="https://your-minio-server.com"
export MINIO_TUI_MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="your-access-key"
export MINIO_TUI_MINIO_SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"
