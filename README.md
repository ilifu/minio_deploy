# minio_deploy

Repository with Terraform and Ansible code to deploy a MinIO S3 object storage server on an OpenStack cloud.

## Description

This project automates the deployment of a MinIO server. It uses Terraform to provision the necessary infrastructure on an OpenStack cloud, including a virtual machine, storage volumes, and networking. Ansible is then used to configure the server, install MinIO, and set up Caddy as a reverse proxy for HTTPS access.

## Terraform Variables

The following variables can be set in a `terraform.tfvars` file to customize the deployment:

| Variable | Description | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ssh_key_public` | The public SSH key to be installed on the server. | `string` | n/a |
| `floating_ip_pool` | The name of the floating IP pool to use. | `string` | `"Ext_Floating_IP"` |
| `server_name` | The name of the server to be created. | `string` | `"minio"` |
| `cidr` | The CIDR for the private network. | `string` | `"192.168.90.0/24"` |
| `server_flavor` | The flavor of the server to be created. | `string` | `"ilifu-B"` |
| `domain_name` | The domain name for the MinIO server. | `string` | n/a |
| `server_image` | The image to use for the server. | `string` | `"20250728-noble"` |
| `minio_volume_size_gib` | The size of each MinIO volume in GiB. | `number` | `64` |
| `minio_volume_count` | The number of MinIO volumes to create. | `number` | `4` |
| `minio_volume_name_prefix` | The prefix for the MinIO volume names. | `string` | `"minio-data"` |
| `locale` | The locale to set on the server. | `string` | `"en_ZA.UTF-8"` |
| `timezone` | The timezone to set on the server. | `string` | `"Africa/Johannesburg"` |

## Running Terraform

1.  **Navigate to the Terraform directory:**

    ```bash
    cd terraform
    ```

2.  **Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:**

    Create a `terraform.tfvars` file in the `terraform` directory to set the required variables. At a minimum, you should set `ssh_key_public` and `domain_name`.

3.  **Initialize Terraform:**

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

4.  **Plan the deployment:**

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5.  **Apply the configuration:**

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

    Terraform will provision the resources and create an `inventory.yaml` file in the `terraform` directory.

## Running Ansible

1.  **Navigate to the root of the project directory.**

2.  **Run the Ansible playbook:**

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i terraform/inventory.yaml ansible/site.yaml
    ```

    Ansible will use the generated inventory to configure the server. The playbook applies the following roles:
    *   `base`: Basic server configuration.
    *   `xfs_mounts`: Formats and mounts the MinIO volumes.
    *   `caddy`: Installs and configures the Caddy reverse proxy.
    *   `minio`: Installs and configures the MinIO server.

## Accessing the MinIO Console

To access the MinIO console, you can use SSH port forwarding. The MinIO console runs on port 9001 on the server, and the API is on port 9000.

1.  **Set up the SSH tunnel:**

    ```bash
    ssh -L 9001:localhost:9001 <user>@<floating_ip>
    ```

2.  **Access the console:**

    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9001`. You will be prompted for the username and password. The admin username is `minioadmin` and the password is automatically generated by Terraform and can be found in the `terraform/inventory.yaml` file after deployment.

## Using the MinIO and AWS Clients

The `mc` and `aws` command-line clients can be run from any machine that has network access to the MinIO server's API endpoint (i.e., the public floating IP address). This is typically your local machine. You will need to have the respective clients installed.

For authenticating with the MinIO API, you will need an **access key** and a **secret key**. For a MinIO user, the access key is their username, and the secret key is their password.

For the initial admin user, the access key is `minioadmin` and the secret key is the password generated by Terraform, which can be found in the `terraform/inventory.yaml` file.

### MinIO Client (`mc`)

The MinIO client (`mc`) is a command-line tool to work with MinIO servers.

1.  **Configure the `mc` client:**

    ```bash
    mc alias set myminio https://<domain_name> <access_key> <secret_key>
    ```

    Replace `<domain_name>` with the domain name you configured, and `<access_key>` and `<secret_key>` with the appropriate credentials (e.g., the `minioadmin` access key and secret key).

2.  **Manage users and policies:**

    *   Add a new user:

        ```bash
        mc admin user add myminio newuser newpassword
        ```

    *   Attach a policy to a user:

        ```bash
        mc admin policy attach myminio readwrite --user newuser
        ```

### AWS CLI Client

The AWS CLI can be used to interact with the MinIO server by specifying the endpoint URL.

1.  **Configure the AWS CLI:**

    You can configure the AWS CLI by setting environment variables:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_key>
    ```

2.  **Use the AWS CLI:**

    When using the AWS CLI, you need to specify the endpoint URL of your MinIO server.

    *   List buckets:

        ```bash
        aws --endpoint-url https://<domain_name> s3 ls
        ```

    *   List objects in a bucket:

        ```bash
        aws --endpoint-url https://<domain_name> s3 ls s3://<bucket-name>
        ```
